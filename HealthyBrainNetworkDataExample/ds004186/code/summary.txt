The table below indicates the total number of EEG files in each release (totalEEG), the total number of phenotype files for the same release (totalPheno) which may be higher because not all participants had their EEG recorded. The processedEEG column contains the number of files that could be processed. The unprocessedEEG column contains the number of participants that were missing eyes-open or eyes-closed EEG. The corrupted EEG column contains the number of EEG files that were corrupted (all of them missing event markers and/or truncated).
